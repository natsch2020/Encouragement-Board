# Encouragement Board

Overview:
A final project for a C# and .NET development course.

Function:
- The project aims to create a way to store and track information regarding how often people have been encouraged and by who.
- It is meant for use with a group of friends that are looking to be intentional about encouraging one another by spending time together.
- Goal is to simply ensure that nobody gets left out or excluded and to reduce any potential favoritism.

Future feature ideas:
- Get serialization working so that information is saved between uses.
- Add a pie chart or other graph type that can summarize the information more quickly.
- Give the UI a makeover to make it more visually appealing.
